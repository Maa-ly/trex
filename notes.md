okay so im parypating in the caspe hackathon and i ned you to help me build the smat ocntract and test it and set it up for my prjct. what im building is an extension/web dapp that tracks a user who opts in's movie/anime/comic/reading and finish, which a user compltes reading a book or manga etc or watching a moie or show they are minted an nft to repretsent that. 
so if im reading the last of us and watching one peiee , when i comple reaing and watching i get 2 nft for each of what i complted watching and reading and the algorithm links me to people who share similar interaests, so if i have watch game of trows na finsih algorith limis me to someone who has watch and ha an nft for bthat. if i wanna read a calculus book an i start i can see users who ahve read too . i can only text them or join groups with them in i have earnd an nft for completing that smae matetial too.
